# What to put here?

Here you can create folders and put any kind of files into them.
Then in your .story files you can reference them in from this folder using the "fsfile://<relative path in this folder to your file>" term.

You can also refer to these files from composite steps - see [compositeSteps folder](../compositeSteps/README.md).

# How does it work?

Simple. This folder is added to the Java classpath too.

# How to structure?

Up to you. But it is a good practice that you create a folder for each of your .story files and place files in them you use in that .story

You can also create some "common" or similar folders if multiple .story files are using the same.
